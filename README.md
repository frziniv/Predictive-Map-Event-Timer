# Predictive-Map-Event-Timer
This repository introduces the PredictiveMapTimer.py module. The module is designed to forecast the precise timing of critical, recurring in-game events (e.g., global resource spawns, objective resets). Accurate prediction of these events is paramount for positioning the agent to gain a decisive first-place competitive advantage.
